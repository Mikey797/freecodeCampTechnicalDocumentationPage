                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document
                    written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                    alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
                <header>
                    <h3>Selector</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes
                    in
                    the markup itself. Selectors may apply to the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
                    <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                        <ul>
                            <li>id: an identifier unique within the document</li>
                            <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,
                    hyphens
                    and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be
                    applied
                    to a single element. </p>
                <p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not
                    contained
                    in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content
                    only
                    when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is
                    appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document
                    elements,
                    such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial
                    elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]
                </p>
                <p>Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple
                    selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class,
                    or
                    any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color:
                    red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div
                    {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Declaration_Block">
                <header>
                    <h3>Declaration Block</h3>
                </header>
                <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of
                    a
                    property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;)
                    must
                    be inserted to separate each declaration.[9]</p>
                <p>Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some
                    properties
                    can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.[10]</p>
                <p>Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200
                    pixels),
                    50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width). Color
                    values
                    can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as
                    #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and
                    alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%),
                    hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).[11]</p>
                <p>Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an
                    alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units –
                    cm
                    (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt (point) – are absolute, which means that
                    the
                    rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – em (em); ex (ex) and px
                    (pixel) – are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent element can
                    affect
                    the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1[12] and retained in all
                    subsequent
                    revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a W3C
                    Recommendation,
                    provide seven further length units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.[13]</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Use">

                    <h3>Use</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML
                    markup.
                    All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
                    described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to
                    another
                    file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.

                    For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined
                    structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for
                    these
                    elements is presentational.

                    Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2
                    headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This
                    made
                    documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the
                    separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size,
                    borders,
                    spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for
                    on-screen
                    and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural
                    text
                    readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[14] </p>

                <code> &lt;h1&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt; Chapter 1. &lt;/font>&lt;/h1&gt; </code>

                <p>Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational
                    attributes: </p>

                <code> 	&lt;h1 style="color: red;"> Chapter 1. &lt;/h1&gt; </code>

                <p>The advantages of this may not be immediately clear (since the second form is actually more verbose),
                    but
                    the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style
                    element
                    or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt; <br>
                            h1 { <br>
                                color: red; <br>
                            } <br>
                            &lt;/style&gt;
            </code>
                <p>
                    rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1
                    element.
                    The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax
                    similar to:
                </p>

                <code>
                    &lt;link href="path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
            </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Sources">
                <header>
                    <h3> Sources</h3>
                </header>
                <p>CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user
                    and
                    the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type,
                    importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style
                    information
                    can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can
                    be
                    imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example,
                    the
                    screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the
                    presentation appropriately for each medium.

                    The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the
                    highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style.
                    The
                    process is called cascading.

                    One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red
                    italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and
                    the
                    web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all
                    added
                    styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic
                    heading style without altering other attributes. </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Specifity">
                <header>
                    <h3> Specifity</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules.[15] It determines which styles apply to
                    an
                    element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has
                    a
                    specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of
                    1,0,0.
                    Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to
                    separate
                    the "digits"[16] (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11,
                    not
                    121).

                    Thus the following rules selectors result in the indicated specificity: </p>
                <p>Consider this HTML fragment:</p>

                <code>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
                    &lt;html&gt;<br>
                    &lt;head&gt;<br>
                    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>
                    &lt;style&gt;<br>
                        #xyz { color: blue; } <br> 
                        &lt;/style&gt; <br>
                        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
                        &lt;body&gt; <br>
                        &lt;p id="xyz" style="color: green;"> To demonstrate specificity &lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/html&gt;<br>
            </code>

                <p>
                    In the above example, the declaration in the style attribute overrides the one in the &lt;style&gt;
                    element because it has a higher specificity, and thus, the paragraph appears green.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate.
                    Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but
                    also
                    to its descendants.[15] Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML
                    elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any
                    ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties,
                    but
                    their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font,
                    letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility,
                    white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display,
                    float
                    and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding,
                    position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.

                    Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet,
                    allowing for shorter CSS.

                    Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based programming languages, where it is
                    possible to define class B as "like class A, but with modifications".[17] With CSS, it is possible
                    to
                    style an element with "class A, but with modifications". However, it is not possible to define a CSS
                    class B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the
                    modifications.

                    parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element is likewise pink.
